# üéâ Welcome to the Amazing Git Project! üéâ

Hello, adventurous coder! If you've landed on this page, you're in for a treat. This project is your gateway to learning, experimenting, and having fun with code. Before we dive into the magic, let's make sure you've got everything you need to get started.

## üîç What's Inside?
Here's what you'll find in this project:

- **Cool Code:** The heart and soul of this project. Dive in and explore!
- **Dependencies:** These are the libraries and tools our code needs to work. Think of them as the behind-the-scenes crew that makes the show run smoothly.
- **README:** Yes, this guide! We'll walk you through everything you need to know to get up and running hopefully.

## üìú Requirements
Every project has a list of things it needs to work properly. For me and you, it's a file called `requirements.txt`. It contains a list of Python packages (dependencies) that our project relies on.

To check it out, just click this link: [View Requirements](./requirements.txt). You'll see a list of packages and their versions. Pretty neat, huh?

## üöÄ Setting Up Your Environment
Okay, let's get you set up to run the project. Don't worry; it's easy!

1. **Python:** Make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Choose the latest version and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Virtual Environment:** This step is optional but recommended. A virtual environment keeps our project's dependencies separate from other projects. To create one:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project folder.
   - Run `python -m venv venv`.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** This is like turning on the lights. Here's how:
   - **Windows:** Run `venv\Scripts\activate`.
   - **macOS/Linux:** Run `source venv/bin/activate`.

4. **Install the Requirements:** Now, let's install the packages from `requirements.txt`. In your terminal, type:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project
Now for the fun part‚Äîrunning the code!

- To run the project, navigate to your project folder in your terminal, then type:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
  This will start the Flask Server on port 5000 e.g 127.0.0.1:5000.

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you're facing issues, don't worry i've got your back! Here are a few common problems and how to resolve them at least the ones i faced:

### Dependency Issues
- **Missing dependencies?**
  - Double-check that you've installed the required packages with:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - If an error persists, there might be a typo in `requirements.txt`. Open the file and verify the package names and versions.

### File Path Errors
- **Getting "File Not Found" errors?**
  - Ensure you're in the correct directory. Use the command:
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
  - If you're not in the right directory, navigate to your project folder before running other commands.

### Other Issues
- **Unexpected error messages?**
  - Read the error message carefully for clues.
  - Try restarting the virtual environment or your terminal.
  - If you're still stuck, reach out for help by creating an issue in this repository.
